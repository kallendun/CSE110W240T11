As a user, I want to be able to find restaurants near me and in my price range to easily find affordable places to eat.


As an indecisive person, I want to have a framework with which to decide what to eat so that I don't spend a lot of time quibbling over it.

As a user, I want to be able to go back a question, so that if I make a mistake, I can easily fix it.


As a user, when I find out what food I want, I want places that serve that food so that I can eat it.


As a user, if at the end the food isn't what I want, I want to be able to restart.


As a user, I want to be able to include a restaurant that I earlier didn't want to, so that I can easily change which restaurants I don't want to eat at.
